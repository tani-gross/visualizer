# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visuzlier for algorithms and data structures that has two main parts:

1. A graph generator that allows you to customize a graph with nodes and edges and run various algorithms on it

2. A sorter that enables you to shuffle a set of bars and run different sorting algorithms to visualize their behavior.
## Features
**Graph Generator:** Create and customize graphs, add nodes and edges, and visualize graph algorithms.
**Sorting Visualizer:** Shuffle bars and visualize sorting algorithms like selection sort and insertion sort.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js
2. npm

### Installation
 1. `git clone` this repository
 2. `cd /visualizer/Visusalizer Project/` to navigate to project directory
 3. `npm install` to install necessary packages
 4. `npm start` to start the application
 5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

### Running the Visualizer
**Graph Generator:** 
 - Use the interface to add nodes and edges
 - Run different graph algorithms to see how they work on the custom graph.

**Sorting Visualizer:**
-   Shuffle the bars using the provided control.
-   Run different sorting algorithms to observe their behavior and performance.
